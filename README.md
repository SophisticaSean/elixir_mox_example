# MoxExample

## Description

This repo is a barebones example of how to use [Mox](https://github.com/plataformatec/mox) and how to configure it during testing.

## Why

I found the existing articles and instructions were insufficient to get me started using Mox so I have created a barebones project
to make it easier on the next person who would like to use this library.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `mox_example` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mox_example, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/mox_example](https://hexdocs.pm/mox_example).
